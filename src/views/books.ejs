          <hr />
          <div>
            <p>
              Gwendolyn Evenshine thought being a fairy godmother would be cut and dried—take on a charge, solve a
              royal problem, and return to the Academy for her next assignment. But she got too close.
            <p/>
            <p>
              When the beloved Princess Francesca is brutally murdered on her watch, Gwen refuses to resume her
              fairy godmother duties. Instead, she laces her docs and hits the streets of Boston in search of the
              bastard who took Frankie from her, a serial killer who operates in lunar cycles. But Gwen’s magic is on
              the fritz, and bodies are piling up.
            </p>

            <p>
              Gwen enlists the talents of Chessa Moon, an upbeat pixie crime blogger who will do anything for a scoop.
              Together, they open new leads as they race against the hunter’s moon. As the killer hits closer and
              closer to home, Gwen is forced to confront her past and nail the killer, or she’ll lose more than just
              her shot at vengeance—she’ll lose the only person in her life worth a damn.
            </p>

              Rent in New Metta is through the cavern ceiling. When Granu barely survives her first gig teaching
              students who attempt to fillet her for lunch, the baby-eating troll ends up unemployed and facing
              eviction. Granu's only prospect for income is grueling work in the tar pits. That is, until her playboy
              best friend devises a perfect, if suicidal, scheme—a heist!
            </p>

            <p>
              The Covered Bridge, the largest source of income for the city, has New Metta well under hoof. In a week,
              TCB Corporation pulls in enough cash to buy a small country. It's the ideal target, but security is
              top-notch. Granu needs three things to survive this heist: a crew of specialists, impenetrable sun
              protection, and gallons of grog.
            </p>

            <p>There’s just one thing Granu doesn’t plan for—those damn meddling billy goats.</p>
