                <p>Sarah J. Sover holds a BS in biology from Georgia Southern University where she graduated as a Bell Honors
                    Scholar. Having lived in many cities, including over-seas, she frequently jokes that she’s already been
                    at least six different people. She’s wife to an amazing man and mother to the most vibrant little girl
                    on earth, and she resides outside of Atlanta, GA. Her interests are varied but her writing is all fantasy.</p>
                <p>So why biology? When she first enrolled in school, Sarah was an English major, but she’s a typical Gryffindor,
                    and the urge to save the world was strong. An influential professor urged her to go into environmental
                    law. She changed majors with that intent but quickly realized that her blunt nature and lack of deception
                    skills made for a terrible poker face and therefore a terrible law career. With no desire to run out
                    of scholarship funds by staying in school for the extra year required to change majors again, Sarah pressed
                    on to earn her BS. She put it to use in the following years rehabilitating wildlife and working as a
                    construction manager for a local municipality.</p>
                <p>While pregnant with her daughter, Sarah had an overwhelming desire to pick up a book she started writing
                    long ago. Just after the birth of her child, her first novel, THE KEY OF ARGOS was born.</p>
