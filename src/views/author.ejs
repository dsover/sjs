                <p><span style="font-size: 32px !important; font-weight: bold" >Sarah J. Sover</span> writes oddball fantasy novels while raising two energetic little people. With a BS in Biology
                    from Georgia Southern University where she graduated as a Bell Honor Scholar, Sarah's background is as
                    varied as Bertie Botts Every Flavour Beans. From wildlife rehabilitator to construction manager, she's
                    done a bit of everything!
                </p>

                <p>Growing up as the daughter of a newsman, Sarah lived all over the place. Each location added to her evolving
                    world view. Detroit, London, Miami, and her current home just outside Atlanta all impacted the way she
                    saw the world. As a result, Sarah tends to connect things in strange and different ways, a trait further
                    developed by an interdisciplinary college education. No matter where she went, Sarah's love of writing
                    followed, filling notebooks with bad poetry and driving her to become the starry-eyed president of a
                    writing club and contributor to school literary magazines.
                </p>

                <p>Sarah resides with her awesome husband Alex, two kids, cranky old dog, and seemingly immortal snake. Her
                    mother is an avid reader who taught her and her little brother to believe in the magic all around us,
                    and Sarah hopes to raise her girls to leave a little room for magic in their lives too!
                </p>

                <p>In addition to writing, Sarah loves craft beer, blues dancing, binging on superhero Netflix shows, making
                    jewelry for her Etsy shop, painting, consuming everything Disney, and listening to groove metal. It's
                    only fitting that her debut novel is an eccentric fantasy caper with a touch of absurdity.
                </p>
